Change log notes for global/sectoral variable template

v1.3:
# 1 Added tier values to Final Energy|Buildings so they appear on Buildings tab
# 2 Removed idx label from data sheet to reduce issues with scenario upload
# 3 Change definition of Emissions|CO2 to specify "net" emissions, 

v2.0

Changes in v2 relate primarily to unit corrections and revision of "Buildings" category to "Residential and Commercial". Thanks to all people who suggested changes and additions.

Please note that for an interim period, submissions with old variables/units will be accepted and converted. Similarly, existing data in the database will be converted. But we highly encourage authors to make the changes in their datasets and test this by resubmitting updated scenarios.


################ CHNAGES TO UNITS ###########################
## Changes to the units from Mt CO2/yr to Mt {XXX}/yr of variables matching this pattern:
Emissions|{XXX}|Energy|Demand|Buildings|Commercial
Emissions|{XXX}|Energy|Demand|Buildings|Residential
Emissions|{XXX}|Energy|Demand|Buildings|Residential and Commercial

## Emissions variables for NOx with units "Mt NOx/yr" corrected to "Mt NO2/yr"
## Emissions variables for N2O with units "Mt N2O/yr" corrected to "kt N2O/yr"

## Currency unit change
All variables with units relating to "{...}US$2010/yr OR local currency" have had reference to local currency removed. 
Applies specifically to variables which had the units:
 - "billion US$2010/yr OR local currency"
 - "billion US$2010/yr OR local currency/yr"
 - "US$2010/GJ OR local currency"
 - "US$2010/GJ or local currency/GJ"
 - "US$2010/kW OR local currency"
 - "US$2010/kW/yr OR local currency"
 - "US$2010/kW/yr OR local currency/kW/yr"

Relates primarily to economic variables, including:
 - Expenditure|...
 - Investment|...
 - Import|...
 - Export|...
 - Policy cost|...
 - GDP|...
 - Value added|...
 - Price|...
 - OM Cost|...
 - Capital Cost|...
 - ...


Corrections to units:
 from EJ/yr to: 
Fertilizer use|Nitrogen|Inorganic 	--> Tg N/yr 
Fertilizer use|Nitrogen|Organic   	--> Tg N/yr
Fertilizer use|Phosphorous|Inorganic	--> Tg P/yr
Fertilizer use|Phosphorous|Organic	--> Tg P/yr
Fertilizer use|Potassium|Inorganic	--> Tg K2O/yr
Fertilizer use|Potassium|Organic	--> Tg K2O/yr

## Variables RENAMED  in Buildings sector  ##
Reason: various complaints of divergence from a commonly agreed convention in legacy projects and causing signfiicant issues and confusion with database
All instances of "Buildings" are renamed to category "Residential and Commercial". This applies to variables with the stem:
 - Discount rate|...
 - Emissions|{XX}|Energy|Demand|...
 - Energy Service|...
 - Final Energy|...
 - Investment|Infrastructure|...
 - Price|Final Energy|...
 - Value Added|...

N.B. former variables (8)
"Final Energy|Buildings|Residential and Commercial|..." are now renamed to:
"Final Energy|Residential and Commercial|..."

Final Energy|Residential and Commercial|Appliances
Final Energy|Residential and Commercial|Cooling
Final Energy|Residential and Commercial|Heating
Final Energy|Residential and Commercial|Heating|Cooking
Final Energy|Residential and Commercial|Heating|Space*
Final Energy|Residential and Commercial|Heating|Water
